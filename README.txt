In order to use this program, you need to have both Python and Pygame installed on your device.

Start by checking if you have Python installed.
Open the command prompt and use the following command:

python --version

If it returns a Python version, you have it installed, otherwise you need to install it.
    Use this offical page to download the latest version of Python:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/

    Don't forget to double-check that it has successfully been isntalled.

Secondly, you must check if PIP is installed.
Use the following command in the command prompt:

pip --version

If it returns a PIP version, you have it installed, otherwise you need to install it.
    Use the following two commands in the command prompt in order to install PIP:

    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    (This command should give you information on a server where you can download PIP.)

    python get-pip.py
    (This command should start collecting the packages PIP and Wheel and then install PIP.)

    Don't forget to double-check that it has successfully been isntalled.

Lastly, check if you have pygame installed.
In the command prompt, use the following commands:

python
(This will start up python in the command prompt.)

import pygame
(This will import any installed Pygame.)

If the last command returns a Pygame version, it is installed, otherwise you need to install it.
    Use the following command in the command prompt:

    pip install pygame
    (This should show that it starts collecting and then installing Pygame.)

    Don't forget to double-check that it has successfully been isntalled.
